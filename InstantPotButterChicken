Calories: 300 kcal
Ingredients
1 14- ounce can diced tomatoes
5-6 cloves garlic
1-2 teaspoons minced ginger
1 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs (or use breast, bone-in, or whatever works for you. If frozen, add 1-2 minutes to total time)
To finish
4 ounces butter cut into cubes (use coconut oil if dairy free)
4 ounces heavy cream (use full-fat coconut milk if dairy free)
1 teaspoon garam masala

Instructions
Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better

Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure. 

Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside
Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender
Let sauce cool slightly before the next step. Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.
